-- Very Hard: 
-- 1. Copy the table from your Very Easy Challenge 
-- 2. Write a query to add in three cars at once 
-- 3. Write a query to add in prices and colors for each of these cars 
-- 4. Write a query to put the Make and Model together in one column 
-- 5. Create a new query that adds an additional column to the results to show how many cars have the same Make.

INSERT INTO carsCopy (make, model, year)

-- Add in two more cars

INSERT INTO carsCopy (make, model, year)

INSERT INTO carsCopy (make, model, year)
VALUES 
('Ford', 'Mustang', 2015),
('Chevrolet', 'Camaro', 2016),
('Jeep', 'Cherokee', 2014);


-- 3. Write a query to add in prices and colors for each of these cars 

ALTER TABLE carsCopy
ADD COLUMN color VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
ADD COLUMN price INT NOT NULL;

UPDATE carsCopy SET color ='White', price= 24380 WHERE id = 1;

UPDATE carsCopy SET color ='Hyper Blue', price= 267000 WHERE id = 7;
UPDATE carsCopy SET color ='Billet Silver', price= 14700 WHERE id = 8;

SELECT * FROM carsCopy;



-- 4. Write a query to put the Make and Model together in one column

SELECT 
    CONCAT_WS(', ', make, model) AS `Car_Type`
FROM
    carsCopy;
    
    
    
-- 5. Create a new query that adds an additional column to the results to show how many cars have the same Make.

UPDATE carsCopy
SET make = 'Ford'
WHERE id = 7;

SELECT 
    make, 
    COUNT(make)
FROM
    carsCopy
GROUP BY make
HAVING COUNT(make) > 1;
